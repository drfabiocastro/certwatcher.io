## Certwatcher Engine

CertWatcher is a security tool designed to analyze SSL/TLS certificates in real time and detect malicious activities, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations on web servers. It accomplishes this by capturing and tracking certificate transparency logs, using YAML templates to detect and analyze phishing sites, as well as other types of malicious activity.

The detection engine of CertWatcher is based on custom YAML templates, which allow users to define rules for detecting patterns in URLs, certificates, and tokens. This flexibility enables the tool to be customized to meet the specific needs of the organization or security team.

In addition to these features, CertWatcher can be integrated with other security tools such as Metasploit and Nmap to perform deeper vulnerability analysis of web systems.

Overall, CertWatcher is a versatile security tool that can improve the security posture of web systems by detecting malicious activity, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations in real time.
